<!--  
 . I have tried to use both curl and postman
 . Main issue is that if I enter this URL in a browser I get:
    {"message":"Flow is disabled"}
 . best response I had using curl and postman was 404.
 . my main workflow look something like :

 - Open Postman.
 - Select the "POST" method.
 - In the "URL" field, enter the following endpoint: https://next.leadconduit.com/flows/581030a78203060429b9d861/sources/5810300fcc72356bf432d4a7/submit
 - In the "Body" section, select "raw" and "JSON (application/json)" as the format.
 - In the Body field, enter the lead data in JSON format.
 - Click "Send" 

Using Curl:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"first_name": "Richard", "last_name": "Angapin", "email": "richardangapin@yahoo.co.uk", "phone": "555-555-5555"}' https://app.leadconduit.com/flows/581030a78203060429b9d861/sources/5810300fcc72356bf432d4a7/submit

Given the above, please submit the required data and provide both the lead ID and the status from the response.

 - dont use the lead import option
 - the example is just an example
 - real data is preferable
